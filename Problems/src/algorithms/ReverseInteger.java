Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store
integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1].
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0
when the reversed integer overflows.
